# 1. Translate the following axioms into RDF Turtle
- 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛 ⊑¬𝐴𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛
    - ⊑--> sublclass
    - ¬ --> negation
    - ⊑¬ --> not in the subclass  
    - “Human” are not members of the class “Alien”

- 𝐹𝑎𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑊𝑖𝑡ℎ𝐷𝑎𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑠 ⊑ 𝑀𝑎𝑛 ⊓ ∀ ℎ𝑎𝑠𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑.𝑊𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑛 
  
  - FatherWithDaughters: This is the class of all individuals that are fathers with daughters.
 
  - ⊑: Indicates that “FatherWithDaughters” is a subclass of what follows.

  - Man: The class of all male individuals.
  
  - ⊓: Denotes the intersection of classes, so “FatherWithDaughters” is a subclass of “Man” and something else.
  
  - ∀hasChild.Woman: This part states that for all relationships described by the property “hasChild”, the children must be members of the class “Woman”.
 
  - “FatherWithDaughters” as a subclass of individuals who are men and have only women as children

- 𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑 ⊑ 𝐻𝑢𝑚𝑎𝑛 ⊓ ∃ 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡.(∃ ℎ𝑎𝑠𝐶ℎ𝑖𝑙𝑑.𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑓)
  - Child: This is the class of all individuals that are children
  
  - ⊑: Indicates that “Child” is a subclass of what follows. 
   
  - Human: The class of all human individuals.
  
  - ⊓: Denotes the intersection of classes, so “Child” is a subclass of “Human” and something else.
  
  - ∃parent: States that there exists at least one relationship described by the property “parent”.
  
  - (∃hasChild.Self): This part specifies that there exists at least one relationship described by the property “hasChild” where the child is the individual itself (reflexive relationship).
  
  - “Child” as a subclass of individuals who are humans and have at least one parent who has a child that is themselves. In other words, it captures the concept of children who are also considered as their own parent’s child, indicating a reflexive relationship

# 4.Use the ALC rules presented on the slides to check if the following ontology is consistent. Draw the derivation tree and explain how the rules are applied.

# 5. Use the ALC rules presented on the slides to check if the ontology entails 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓(𝑃𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟). Draw the derivation tree and explain how the rules are applied. Note that 𝐴≡𝐵 (equivalence) is a shortcut for the two axioms 𝐴⊑𝐵 and 𝐵 ⊑𝐴
