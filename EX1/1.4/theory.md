 JSON-LD (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) is a serialization format for RDF (Resource Description Framework) data, designed to be easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines. It allows RDF data to be represented in JSON format while maintaining compatibility with RDF semantics.
